# The DOM and Event-Driven Programming

## `document.write()` adds to the HTML being rendered

* The JS console log is a bit more out of the way to get to
* Plus this allows us display output to the user via JS!
* Drawbacks:
    * Newlines added to the document, not the rendered page
    * Need to write HTML to the document

-###-

How would you apply it to a detailed web page?

-###-

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Simple Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a page!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

## HTML is very carefully structured

* If only we could access specific HTML elements and alter their properties...
* This is exactly the goal of the Document Object Model (DOM)
* Built up in an ad-hoc manner over the 1990s by Netscape and Microsoft (independently) to help JS interact with the HTML document being rendered
* Known now as "Legacy DOM", or DOM Level 0
* First standard (DOM Level 1) published in 1998
* Followed by DOM Level 2 in 2000, DOM Level 3 in 2004
* Latest DOM Level 4 recommendation was published in Nov 2015

## Consider this HTML

```html
<!-- My document -->
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Header</h1>
  <p>
    Paragraph
  </p>
</body>
</html>
```

* What does the DOM do to help us edit this document as its being rendered? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## `document`

* Object representing the document as a whole
* `document.children` provides a list of the Elements that are a direct child of the document
* `document.body` will reference the `<body>` element of an HTML document
* `document.createElement(tagname)` can be used to add create new Elements with a specified tagname
* To be rendered, the newly created Element must be appended to the document as a child of some Node
    * An HTMLElement is an Element
    * An Element is a Node
* `document.getElementById(id)` allows us to quickly locate Elements with a given value for the `id` attribute

-###-

## DOM Nodes

* `Node.childNodes` will provide a list of the children of a given node
    * Nodes and Elements, unlike `document.children`
    * A NodeList, not an array!
        * Though it can still be indexed
* `Node.appendChild(node)` adds a new Node into the document
* `Node.removeChild(child)` removes child from the document
* `Node.replaceChild(new_node, old_child)` replaces `old_child` with `new_node` in the document

## Event-Driven Programming

* Would have been nice to be able to see the base page and then trigger the alerts somehowâ€¦
    * Maybe a click
    * Or even hovering the mouse over a portion of the page
* This is the basic idea of event-driven programming
* The flow of the program is determined by user actions
* Our applications with *listen* for events to occur, and then run specified functions when they do

## Well, this sucks!

* Either traverse the entire structure or use an ID
* CSS has an easy way to select elements from the document
* CSS selectors!

-###-

## JQuery

* JQuery is a very popular JS library the provided a way to use CSS selectors to select elements from the document
* Also abstracted away alot of DOM code and cross-browser support
* How is it imported?

-###-

## Importing JQuery

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js">
</script>
```

## JQuery Tradeoffs

* Including JQuery has a cost
* While almost necessary a few years ago, can be avoided now for more lightweight options:
    * `document.querySelector(selector)`
    * `document.querySelectorAll(selector)`
* [An Overview of Differences](http://callmenick.com/post/jquery-functions-javascript-equivalents)

-###-

## Javascript vs JQuery

```javascript
// Javascript
var wrapper = document.getElementById("wrapper"),
    els = wrapper.querySelectorAll("p");
```

```javascript
// JQuery
var els = $("#wrapper p");
```

-###-

## Event Listeners

* E.g., `elt.addEventListener('click',clickTheBox, false);`
    * `useCapture` parameter
* Consider table entries (td elements).
    * They're contained within table rows
    * Which are contained within tables
    * Which are contained within the body of the document
    * What happens when you want to handle click events on the body of the document, a table within that body, and an element within that table?

-###-

## Order of Firing and Listening

* What order should the events fire in?
* Use the structure of the DOM to determine!

-###-

## DOM Event Orders

Note:

Note the lowest element in the DOM won't be affected by useCapture, only visited once, hence it gets its own phase
